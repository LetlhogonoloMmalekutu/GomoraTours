Android travel app that provides a list of top attractions, dining, shopping, and hotels for visitors in the city of Mississauga. 

_This app is created as the sixth project of Android Basics Nanodegree program at Udacity._

**Features:**
- Find the top attractions and places to visit in Mississauga.
- Tabbed navigation pattern for quick and easy navigation.
- Design support for both portrait and landscape orientation.

**What I have learned from this project:**
- Planning an app design and navigation before coding.
- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
- Navigating between sections using ViewPager and TabLayout.
- Creating custom plain object Java object (POJO) class that serve as the data model.
- Using CardView from the design support library to display each list item neatly.
